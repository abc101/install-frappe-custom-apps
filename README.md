### üê≥ Docker Setup for Frappe Apps (Without Traefik)

Use this script to deploy **Frappe (without Traefik)** along with its associated applications ‚Äî **ERPNext**, **HRMS**, and **Payments** ‚Äî in your Docker environment.

This installation automatically pulls pre-packaged Git dependencies from the container registry:
`ghcr.io/abc101/frappe-custom-apps`

> ‚öôÔ∏è The Docker image tag (version) **must match** the image version specified in `frappe_docker/pwd.yml`.

---

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp example.env user.env
   ```
2. Run the installation script:

   ```bash
   ./install-frappe-apps.sh
   ```
3. Sit back ‚Äî your Frappe environment is now ready!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Upgrade and Version Management

Starting from this release, `install-frappe-apps.sh` automatically detects existing deployments and handles upgrades safely.

#### üß≠ How it works

1. **Version Gate**  
   Before proceeding, the script compares the currently installed ERPNext version with the target version defined in `frappe_docker/pwd.yml` or `FRAPPE_ERPNEXT_VERSION`.  
   - If the target version is **newer**, the upgrade continues automatically.  
   - If the versions are **identical or older**, the script stops to prevent unnecessary redeployment.  
   - You can override this behavior with:
     ```bash
     FORCE_UPGRADE=yes ./install-frappe-apps.sh
     ```

2. **Upgrade Modes**
   - **Default (Upgrade in-place)** ‚Äî preserves all existing data (database, files, and sites).  
     The script automatically performs:
       - Full backup (DB + files)
       - Maintenance mode
       - `docker compose pull && up -d`
       - Database migration (`bench migrate`)
       - Asset rebuild (`bench build --production`)
       - Restart and maintenance off  
   - **Fresh Reinstall (Destroy everything)** ‚Äî removes all containers and volumes before reinstalling.  
     You can explicitly choose this mode interactively or run:
     ```bash
     INSTALL_MODE=fresh SKIP_CONFIRM=yes ./install-frappe-apps.sh
     ```

3. **First-Time Install**
   If no previous installation is detected, the script automatically performs a clean (fresh) installation.

4. **Backups**
   During upgrades, backups are automatically created inside the container and copied to:

### üß™ Advanced Options

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|----------------------|--------------|----------|
| `INSTALL_MODE` | `upgrade` (preserve data) or `fresh` (reinstall everything) | `upgrade` if existing, otherwise `fresh` |
| `FORCE_UPGRADE` | Force redeploy even if versions are equal | `no` |
| `SKIP_CONFIRM` | Skip interactive confirmation prompts | unset |
| `HOST_BACKUP_DIR` | Path to store backups on the host | `./backups/<bench>-<timestamp>` |

### üß± Building Your Own Image

If you want to build a custom Docker image with your own app versions, use the following script instead:

```bash
./docker-builder-frappe-apps.sh
```

and then set `CUSTOM_IMAGE` with your docker image repository in your `user.env` for `install-frappe-apps.sh`.
